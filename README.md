# Welcome to Earthrise Commons: a sustainability learning hub

We are transforming a forthcoming book anthology, Sustainability Learning for Action & Community Engagement, into a dynamic sustainability education platform called the Earthrise Learning Commons. This platform will connect educators (high school through college undergraduate) with free, accessible, adaptable, and shareable content to support sustainability education and action.

## Features:

The platform will include:

- Original book chapters, hosted via SpringerLink
- Lesson plans that educators can modify
- Interactive resources and videos
- A toolbox of sustainability competencies and frameworks
- Student work examples (with permission)
